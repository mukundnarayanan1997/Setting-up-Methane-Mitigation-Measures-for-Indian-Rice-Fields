# Data
### 1. District-Level Emission Factors Data
This dataset contains emission factors at the district level under various water regimes, which include 
| Acronym      | Description                                                                                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IR-CF        | Irrigated fields have standing water throughout the rice growing season and may only dry for harvest. Alternative names: Saturated fields, flooded fields, water retained through the season, etc. |
| IR-IF-SA     | Irrigated fields having a single aeration of more than three days during the cropping season at any growth stage.       |
| IR-IF-MA     | Irrigated fields having more than one aeration of more than three days period during the cropping season.               |
| RF-DP        | Rainfed rice fields with drought periods occur during every cropping season.                                            |
| RF-FP-DW     | Rainfed rice fields with the water level rising to 50 cm during the cropping season/to more than 50 cm for a significant period during the cropping season / Fields inundated with water depth from 50-100 cm / Fields inundated with water depth > 100 cm. |


### 2. Estimated Methane Emissions Data
This is the final emissions data along with their uncertainties after monte carlo simulations

### 3. Literature Synthesis Data
This dataset compiles findings from various studies on methane emissions in rice fields in India. A total of 68 field-scale experimental studies and two syntheses were selected from existing literature. This synthesis revealed that the rainfed-flood-prone and deep-water (RF-FP-DW) types have identical emissions in the Indian context; hence, these classes were grouped. The total data available for the synthesis resulted in 726 measurements across 43 locations in India. 

### 4. Mitigation Model Data
This dataset includes model data used to simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of various methane mitigation measures. It contains variables such as animal manure, rice residue, N fertilizer, water input, rice yield, precipitation, temperature, soil organic carbon stock, and various global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP) metrics over different time horizons (20, 50, and 100 years).
